### Overview

This repository provides code, exercises and solutions for popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These are meant to serve as a learning tool to complement the theoretical materials from

- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)
- [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html)

All code is written in Python 3 and uses RL environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). Advanced techniques use [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for neural network implementations.

Reinforcement Techniques:

- Dynamic Programming
  - [Policy and Value Iteration- Frozen Lake](https://github.com/dhavalsalwala/rl-algos/blob/master/rltechniques/dynamic_programming/Run_FrozenLake.py)
